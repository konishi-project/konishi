# What is this
**First of all, Konishi is NOT Kamina.**

The Konishi project is an initiative to build a minimalistic, dynamic
discussion board. The goal is to closely imitate the core Facebook group
experience in a standalone setting, without unnecessary cruft and with focus on
performance and responsiveness.

The project will include a Facebook bot aiding in migration of an existing
Facebook group to Konishi.

# Documentation
There are installation instructions for every part of Konishi in the README of each repository. Next to that, there is a (barebones) [installation instruction](https://github.com/konishi-project/konishi/blob/master/Documentation/Installation_instructions.md) for the whole package, which includes setting up the requirements for the package; and documentation of how all the parts fit together to serve Konishi in the [Architecture Overview](https://github.com/konishi-project/konishi/blob/master/Documentation/Konishi_Architecture.MD). It's suggested to start at the last link, as that one will be updated most frequently.

# Progress

Konishi is currently in Phase One, which will end with a minimal viable product
ready to support a community.

Check the progress on the [project
board](https://github.com/orgs/konishi-project/projects/1).

Later, Phase Two will deal with creation of the Facebook bot and support of
first migration of a Facebook group to a Konishi instance. Afterwards, Phase
Three will deal with long term evolution.
