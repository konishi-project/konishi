# What is this

The Konishi project is an initiative to build a minimalistic, dynamic
discussion board. The goal is to closely imitate the core Facebook group
experience in a standalone setting, without unnecessary cruft and with focus on
performance and responsiveness.

The project will include a Facebook bot aiding in migration of an existing
Facebook group to Konishi.

# Progress

Konishi is currently in Phase One, which will end with a minimal viable product
ready to support a community.

Check the progress on the [project
board](https://github.com/orgs/konishi-project/projects/1).

Later, Phase Two will deal with creation of the Facebook bot and support of
first migration of a Facebook group to a Konishi instance. Afterwards, Phase
Three will deal with long term evolution.
